This project serves as template for an altium raspberry pi and/or arduino project. The shield is a combination of an arduino shield and a raspberry pi 3 shield. The template is based on my raspberry pi template  and this Arduino uno template. The project comes with a main sheet as starting point for future projects.
You can find the project on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/NilsMinor/Raspberry-Pi-3-Arduino-Altium-Shield).

#### Dimensions and isometric view

The shield supports Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3 mounting holes.
