This Project should simplify the design process of modules for raspberry pi 2 and 3, model B. 
It uses the 40 pin GPIO connector to access the raspberry pi GPIOs. The dimensions of the board are based on the image below which i got from the raspberry pi developers page.

Iâ€™ve made this template for a friend of mine to build a raspberry pi weather station and to accelerate the board development.
However I can not ensure the correctness of the design, since it was not produced in the moment (but in the future). Use it as it is without any guarantee from me. If you find a mistake please let me know it ðŸ™‚

You can download it from [here](https://github.com/NilsMinor/Raspberry-Pi-3-Altium-Template).

Post edit (04.03.2018) I built a second template. It is a combination of an [Arduino and raspberry pi shield](https://github.com/NilsMinor/Raspberry-Pi-3-Arduino-Altium-Shield).
