### Ahoi ✌️
My name is Nils, I am 26 and located in Wiesbaden.
The past 5 year I worked for a small EMS company responsible for hardware development and manufacturing.
In this time I learned a lot about the creation of electronics. 
In this time I created more 25 circuit boards for a variety of applications for industrial and medical customers.

In 2019 I left the EMS company to start a company with two friends - http://electronic-fellows.de. 
This is where I moved from hardware related programming languages to typescript and web development.

I am still fascinated by electronics and making stuff.  This github page is used to document some of my private projects.
